# Face-Counting-Challenge
People detection and head counting is one of the classical albeit challenging computer vision application. For this problem, given a group selfie/photo, you are required to count the number of heads present in the picture. You are provided with a training set of images with coordinates of bounding box and head count for each image and need to predict the headcount for each image in the test set.
